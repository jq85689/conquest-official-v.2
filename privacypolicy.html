  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>1. Responsible Party</h2>
  <p>
    Jonas Klein<br />
    57462 Olpe<br />
    Email: <a href="mailto:jonaskleinolpe03@gmail.com">jonaskleinolpe03@gmail.com</a>
  </p>

  <h2>2. Hosting and Data Processing</h2>
  <p>
    The website is hosted on a static hosting provider. Basic server logs (such as requests and technical metadata) may be processed by the host for security and performance purposes. The host's privacy and GDPR practices apply to that data. Check your hosting provider's privacy documentation for details.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Analytics and Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    This website uses Plausible Analytics to gather anonymous, privacy-friendly usage statistics. Plausible is only loaded and run if you explicitly accept the cookie/analytics banner shown when you first visit the site. If you decline, Plausible is never loaded and no analytics are recorded for your browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    What Plausible collects: Plausible is configured to collect minimal, aggregate information such as pageviews, referrer, device type, and events (for example, when you share the app). Plausible is designed to avoid collecting personal data such as full IP addresses in a way that identifies individuals. For full details, see <a href="https://plausible.io/privacy" target="_blank">Plausibleâ€™s privacy statement</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Local Storage and App Data</h2>
  <p>
    The app stores small amounts of state locally in your browser using <code>localStorage</code>. This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Application state (progress, level, streaks, completed tasks) to provide a persistent single-user experience on this device.</li>
    <li>Cookie consent choice (<code>conquest_cookie_consent</code>) to remember whether you accepted or declined analytics.</li>
    <li>A local admin-only private visits counter and settings (if you enable and use the admin panel). This data is stored only in your browser and is not transmitted to any server by default.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Admin Panel and Private Visits</h2>
  <p>
    The app includes an optional browser-local admin panel protected by a PIN that allows the site owner to view and manage a private visits counter. The admin panel and its data are stored only in your browser's localStorage and are not shared unless you export them manually. If you enable "Auto-track" in the admin settings, the private counter will increment only for users who accepted analytics (cookie consent).
  </p>

  <h2>6. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You can opt out of analytics at any time by clicking "Decline" in the cookie banner. That will prevent Plausible from loading in your browser. To change your choice later you can clear site data or use the admin panel controls if applicable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Under GDPR you have the right to access, correct, or delete any personal data held about you. If you believe the site to have stored personal data about you and you wish to exercise these rights, contact: <a href="mailto:jonaskleinolpe03@gmail.com">jonaskleinolpe03@gmail.com</a>
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
